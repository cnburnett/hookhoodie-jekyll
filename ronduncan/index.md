# About Ron

Ron passed peacefully surrounded by close family on Friday October 20, 2023.  He had just celebrated his 80th birthday one month earlier and had been living life to the fullest.

Ron was a lifelong lover of all things food, fishing and fiddling, particularly during his retirement in the beautiful city of Victoria, British Columbia.

Ron was a teacher and administrator in London, Ontario for 33 years.

He was a lifelong learner: with particular interests in the fiddle, fly-tying and Tai Chi. After learning Tai Chi, he enjoyed teaching the art to others.

Ron appreciated traveling, exploring new cultures and being in nature. Many years were enjoyed at the family cottage, canoe tripping and fishing/camping expeditions with his family and friends.

Much loved by his life partner, his two children, five grandchildren and wide circle of family and friends. He passed peacefully surrounded by family.

His adventurous spirit lives on.

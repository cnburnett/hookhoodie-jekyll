    April 21, 1947 – May 5, 2024
</p>

<p>Beverley Ann Hoskins (nee Lindstrom), 77, died May 5, 2024 in Edmonton from long-term complications of scleroderma.</p>

<p>Born in Christchurch, New Zealand she moved to Canada in 1974 alongside her husband Dr. Christopher F. Hoskins, where they went on to create a life together. She joins Chris, who passed away in 2022, and is survived by her 4 children (Verena, Andrew, Ryan and Zoë), their spouses, and 10 grandchildren.</p>

<p>In her heart she was a wanderlust, which led to adventures across Canada and the globe. Along the way she made countless friends, who she kept for a lifetime. She was an exceptional listener, with a genuine curiosity about others. Her love language was giving time, and she found time for many.</p>

<p>A Celebration of Life will was hosted on May 26, 2024 at the Shoctor Theatre Lobby of Edmonton's Citadel Theatre starting at 1300. The address is 9828 101A Ave.</p>

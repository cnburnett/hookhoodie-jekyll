    18 January, 1931 – 14 August, 2024
</p>

On August 14, 2024, we said goodbye to our Mummles, the Marvelous Mae Browne, at 93 years young. Mae was born on January 18, 1931 in Grangetown, England. She is dearly missed by children Anthea (Zack), Murray (Memet), Colleen, Trevor (Amelie) and Lori, and grandchildren Cendrine, Lalique, Liam, Justine, Noah, Piper, Seanrei, Hamish, Fenna and Lee-Ann. Mae spent her last few years at the Priory Hospital, and the family is infinitely grateful for the loving care she received there.

Mae’s long life has spanned the years from World War II to Covid 19 and beyond. She was the youngest of four - a cheerful child who was always singing. At 16 she emigrated with her parents to Canada following her older sister, after which she returned to England to ignite her singing career, ending up on contract in India performing for maharajahs and princes.

On returning to Canada, she met Dave Browne at a YMCA dance in Vancouver in 1958, charmed by his blue eyes, infectious grin, and plans for a bright future. They moved to Kelowna, raising an active family in a well-designed (by Mae) home with a cherry orchard and willow tree, and a stunning view of the Okanagan Lake.

In the 90’s Mae & Dave retired to Sechelt to do some sailing and traveling. When we lost Dave to cancer, Mae relocated to Nanaimo, spending her time walking forest trails, leading pub shows for church fundraisers, and visiting her grandchildren, eventually with retired Merchant Navy Man, BC Ferry Boat Captain and master storyteller, Robert Osborne.

From 2012 onwards, Mae resided in Victoria, surrounded by family. She attended the Victoria Iyengar Yoga Centre, played Scrabble at the Juan de Fuca Seniors Centre and sang with her daughter in the choir at the Church of the Advent in Colwood. During her final years she spread love everywhere, blowing 'crazy mixed up' kisses to kids, and tossing compliments like confetti. Mae sang right to the end, as we gathered around her with love and music. She will be so greatly missed.
